        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>spaghetti</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 Â¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                    Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
                    until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 
                    1 cup cooking water, then drain spaghetti.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and 
                    stir garlic and pepper in hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                    Add cooked spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup 
                    reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. 
                    Stir in more cooking water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until 
                    sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.</li>
                
            </ol>
